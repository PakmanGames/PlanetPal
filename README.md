# Terrahacks hackathon project

## Inspiration
- An estimated 1 in every 5 items sent for recyling is contaminated and cannot be recycled, amounting to an estimated 46,000 tons of contaminated recyling produced by America every day.
- It costs governments millions to treat the waste, but most importantly, it harms the environment by further adding to overdumped landfills and polluting the air and environment. - Our AI-powered waste management assistant, PlanetPal, aims to change this.
##  What it does
- PlanetPal is a web app powered by cutting-edge generative AI technologies made to revolutionize education in waste management.
- Ask the assistant ANY question regarding which bin to throw your waste, and they will answer!
## ⚒️ How we built it
Our project is a React project bootstrapped with vite for the frontend. For the backend we incorporate the OpenAI API to utilize their gpt-3.5-turbo LLM. Along with this, we utilized various packages such as react-router-dom, axios, gsap, and @emailjs/browser to implement various features in our web app such as routes, API connections, and animated styling.

- React
- OpenAI api
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- Node.js
## Challenges we ran into
- Implementing EmailJS so that messages written in the contact page could get to us
- Having to learn and implement emerging/new technologies
- Time management and orginization; planning our schedules and acheiving soft deadlines 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Our problem statement and idea; we spent time contemplating but landed on this idea and instnatly knew it owuld be a hit.
- Our About section on our web app came out much better than expected once we applied CSS and React transformations.
## What we learned
- Learning and refining our ReactJS skills! We came into this project with limited React experience and came out as experienced Reactors&copy;.
