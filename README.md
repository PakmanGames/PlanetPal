# Terrahacks hackathon project

## Inspiration
- An estimated 1 in every 5 items sent for recyling is contaminated and cannot be recycled, amounting to an estimated 46,000 tons of contaminated recyling produced by America every day.
- It costs governments millions to treat the waste, but most importantly, it harms the environment by further adding to overdumped landfills and polluting the air and environment. - Our AI-powered waste management assistant, PlanetPal, aims to change this.
## What it does
- PlanetPal is a web app powered by cutting-edge generative AI technologies made to revolutionize education in waste management.
- Ask the assistant ANY question regarding which bin to throw your waste, and they will answer!
## How we built it
- OpenAI api
- HTML/CSS
- ReactJS
## Challenges we ran into
- Implementing EmailJS so that messages written in the contact page could get to us
- Having to learn and implement emerging/new technologies
- Time management and orginization; planning our schedules and acheiving soft deadlines
